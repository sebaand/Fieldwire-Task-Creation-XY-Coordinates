This is program is designed to scrap our shop drawings for specific call outs as per a refernce file selected by the user.
The program searches for those call outs in the pdf and calcualtes the X - Y position of the call outs with respect to the 
page, and then outputs the corresponding values into a .csv which can be copied directly into the task importer in fieldwire.

Must have:
- Reference Call out file must be a single column .csv file
- The shop drawings file must be an unflatted .pdf file. 

Any questions please feel free to reach out to the author: andrea.sebastio@hilti.com
